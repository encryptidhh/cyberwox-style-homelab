# CyberWOX-Style Cybersecurity Homelab
This project was based on a tutorial from Day Cyberwox over on CyberWOX academy [(link here)](https://blog.cyberwoxacademy.com/post/building-a-cybersecurity-homelab).
It's always been on my agenda to build a homelab according to this tutorial; however, I struggled with setting up the virtual machines and the required networking:

This project was built to replicate an enterprise-style cybersecurity environment, enabling hands-on practice with system administration, SOC workflows, and security monitoring. By configuring Splunk SIEM and Active Directory within an isolated network, the lab serves as a foundation for log analysis, intrusion detection, and blue-team skill development.

## How to Use this Repo
This repository serves only to document the issues I encountered while setting up my homelab. I don't have a separate tutorial to provide, as (for the most part), I followed CyberWOX's tutorial to the letter, apart from using OPNSense rather than pfSense for my chosen firewall.
